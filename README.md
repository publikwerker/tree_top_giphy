## Tree Top Giphy Go!
This is a quick app to search giphy api and return gifs.

### The Process
1. Started a Pomodoro timer. Seeing that count-down really helps me focus.
2. Go to Giphy, acquire API Key
3. Created GitHub repository and create-react-app. My computer is pretty slow, so while that processed, I drew up some wireframes.
4. Opened Postman to test endpoint
5. Created a Body component with state to handle the values of the query and the returned array of gifs. I also added a display key to show results
